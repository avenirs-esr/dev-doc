### Introduction / resources

This site is built with [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} with the site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. \
The dialect used is [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/){:target="_blank"} ; [GFM Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/roshith-balendran/d50b32f8f7d900c34a7dc00766bcfb9c){:target="_blank"}.\
The theme is built on [minima.](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)\
The [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/){:target="_blank"} support has been added just like for the [Github repositories](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/){:target="_blank"}.

### How to add a page
The pages are located in the directory pages. To add a page create a markdow page and put it in a new subdirectory. 

#### Add a page to the menu
This is one via custom properties in the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/03-front-matter/){:target="_blank"} of the page:
<pre>
---
(... other properties) 
is_menu_entry: true            // The page is displayed in the menu.
position: left                 // It is placed in the left region (could be center or right).
order: 1                       // The link will be placed at first position in the left region. 
---
</pre>

### How to add metting report

The meeting reports are located in the spécific [jekyll's_post folder](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/){:target="_blank"}. \
The files in this directory are listed by Jekyll and respect this naming convention : YYYY-MM-DD-Title-of-the-report.markdown (e.g.: 2023-09-01-kick-off-meeting.markdown).\
To add a new report, add a file which respects this naming convention in the _post directory.

#### Reports metadata

These properties can be used to generate quickly the reports. 

##### Simple report

        ]
    }

</pre>

### Charts and diagrams : Mermaid support

[Mermaid charts](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/){:target="_blank"} can be added in the markdown pages :


This code :
<pre>
```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
</pre>

Will be rendered as this Diagram :
```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

### Test locally
The GitHub Pages site is set to be built from the main branch. As it can take some time to be published after a commit (up to 10 minutes), it is convenient to test locally first.
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/avenirs-esr/dev-doc
